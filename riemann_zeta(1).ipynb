    "\n",
    "### **Good enough**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, as a general rule, it's reasonable to implement a version of your function that works well in a limited set of cases rather than not-so-well in a large collection of cases. If you can do nothing else, the best thing would be to program a function that can:\n",

    "### **Convergence**\n",

    "The Riemann zeta function results from an infinite series. Obviously, you will somehow need to truncate the sum at a finite number of terms. There are several considerations in this regard. \n",

If you are doing things right, you might spend a fair bit of your time googling to see if `numpy` does this or that. When I wrote the solutions, I had to figure out how to fix a couple of minor type conversion issues involving `int`, `float` and `complex` for `np.array` objects.

    "* You are going to what to check if your input is an array or not. You can do this in several ways. For example, a `try` block, or `isinstance`, or something else. Google these if you haven't picked up the lingo quite yet. \n",

    "\n",
    "* For speed, you will do *much better* if you rely on `numpy` as much as possible. You probably can do everything in a Pythion loop. And some things will probably require an old-fashioned Python loop. But the more you can offload to optimised `numpy` functions, the better. \n",
